## Installation

QudiaColorWheel is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'QudiaColorWheel'
```

## Usage

You can use `QudiaColorWheel` in a SwiftUI view structure, as well as `QudiaColorWheelController` in your storyboard, if you need to support watchOS 6.

### Usage in a SwiftUI view structure

Just use  `QudiaColorWheel` as a normal SwiftUI view.

```swift
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Text("Select a Color")
        QudiaColorWheel()
    }
}
```

### Usage in the Storyboard

To use QudiaColorWheel in the storyboard, add a new Hosting Controller and change its Custom Class as follows:

**Class:** QudiaColorWheelController  
**Module:** QudiaColorWheel

Make sure to **uncheck** Inherit Module From Target.

### Attributes

To get all the different attributes and modify the selected color from SwiftUI, initialize `QudiaColorWheelSettings.shared` as an `ObservedObject`:

```swift
@ObservedObject var colorWheelSettings = QudiaColorWheelSettings.shared
```

You can **get/set the currently selected color** with `colorWheelSettings.color`.

To get the **border color** QudiaColorWheel is currently using for the thumb view, use `colorWheelSettings.borderColor`.

To get whether **a color is light or dark**, use `colorWheelSettings.isLightColor`.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
